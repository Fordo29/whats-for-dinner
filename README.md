# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. Finally there is an app to help you decide when you don't know what you are craving! This application will randomly put together a variety of side dishes, Main Dishes and desserts.  No longer will you have a reason to be undecided!

This solo project was designed to expose me to how HTML, CSS and javascript all work together in harmony. I discovered quickly that you need a sound and organized HTML first before moving on to Javascript and CSS.  Also ensuring your Javascript was working well before finally refactoring your CSS.  


The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

## Instructions for using this page

Try it out yourself! Select a radio button for a single food item or an entire meal and see what will be chosen for you!  If you do not select a radio button the "Let's Cook" button will not work at all.  ![Screen Shot 2021-10-31 at 6 28 55 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90149529/139607849-66cff11f-0552-41c7-92ab-d29c697f97e1.png)
