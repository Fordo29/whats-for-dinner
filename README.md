# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. Finally there is an app to help you decide when you don't know what you are craving! This application will randomly put together a variety of side dishes, Main Dishes and desserts.  No longer will you have a reason to be undecided!

This solo project was designed to expose me to how HTML, CSS and javascript all work together in harmony. I discovered quickly that you need a sound and organized HTML first before moving on to Javascript and CSS.  Also ensuring your Javascript was working well before finally refactoring your CSS.
